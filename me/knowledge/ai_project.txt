# Autonomous Drone Delivery System

## Project Overview
I led the development of an autonomous drone delivery system that revolutionizes last-mile logistics. The project combines computer vision, path planning algorithms, and real-time obstacle avoidance to enable safe and efficient package delivery in urban environments.

## Technical Details

### Computer Vision System
- Implemented YOLOv5 for object detection and classification
- Used depth estimation from stereo cameras to create 3D maps
- Developed custom algorithms for landing zone identification
- Accuracy rate of 98.7% for obstacle detection

### Flight Control
- Created a custom flight controller using ROS (Robot Operating System)
- Implemented adaptive PID controllers for stable flight in various weather conditions
- Developed a fail-safe system with redundant sensors and emergency landing protocols
- Battery optimization algorithms extended flight time by 27%

### Backend Infrastructure
- Built on AWS using a serverless architecture with Lambda functions
- Used DynamoDB for delivery tracking and drone status
- Implemented real-time communication with drones using MQTT
- Achieved 99.99% uptime over 6 months of operation

## Achievements and Metrics
- Reduced delivery time by 73% compared to traditional methods
- Decreased operational costs by 42%
- Completed over 10,000 successful deliveries
- Won the 2023 Innovation in Logistics Award
- Patent pending for our novel landing zone detection system

## Challenges Overcome
One of the biggest challenges was developing a system that could safely navigate in unpredictable urban environments. We solved this by implementing a multi-layered safety approach:

1. Pre-flight path planning using updated map data
2. Real-time obstacle detection and avoidance during flight
3. Continuous risk assessment algorithm that adapts flight parameters
4. Remote operator monitoring system for edge cases

## Team and Collaboration
I led a cross-functional team of 15 members including:
- 5 software engineers
- 3 hardware specialists
- 2 AI researchers
- 3 UX designers
- 2 regulatory experts

We used agile methodology with 2-week sprints and maintained a deployment frequency of once per week for backend updates and once per month for drone firmware.

## Future Directions
We're currently working on:
- Expanding to rural delivery with enhanced battery technology
- Implementing swarm capabilities for multiple drones
- Developing advanced weather prediction integration
- Creating a drone-to-drone package transfer system for extended range
